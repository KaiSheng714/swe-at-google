# 挑战既定流程
挑战自己建立更公平的系统不仅仅是设计更具包容性的产品规格。 建立公平的系统有时意味着挑战导致无效结果的既定流程。

Challenging yourself to build more equitable systems goes beyond designing more inclusive product specifications. Building equitable systems sometimes means challenging established processes that drive invalid results.

考虑最近评估公平影响的案例。 在谷歌，几个工程团队致力于建立一个全球招聘申请系统。 该系统支持外部招聘和内部流动。 所涉及的工程师和产品经理在听取他们认为是核心用户群体的要求方面做得很好：招聘人员。 招聘人员专注于尽量减少招聘经理和申请人浪费的时间，他们向开发团队展示了专注于这些人的规模和效率的用例。 为了提高效率，招聘人员要求工程团队在内部调动表示对工作感兴趣时，立即向招聘经理和招聘人员突出绩效评级（特别是较低的评级）的功能。

Consider a recent case evaluated for equity implications. At Google, several engineer‐ ing teams worked to build a global hiring requisition system. The system supports both external hiring and internal mobility. The engineers and product managers involved did a great job of listening to the requests of what they considered to be their core user group: recruiters. The recruiters were focused on minimizing wasted time for hiring managers and applicants, and they presented the development team with use cases focused on scale and efficiency for those people. To drive efficiency, the recruiters asked the engineering team to include a feature that would highlight performance ratings—specifically lower ratings—to the hiring manager and recruiter as soon as an internal transfer expressed interest in a job.

从表面上看，加快评估过程并帮助求职者节省时间是一个伟大的目标。 那么潜在的股权问题在哪里？ 提出了以下公平问题：

* 发展性评估是绩效的预测性衡量标准吗？
* 向潜在经理提供的绩效评估是否没有个人偏见？
* 绩效评估分数是否跨组织标准化？

如果对这些问题中的任何一个的答案是“否”，那么提供绩效评级仍然可能导致不公平的结果，因此是无效的。

On its face, expediting the evaluation process and helping jobseekers save time is a great goal. So where is the potential equity concern? The following equity questions were raised:

* Are developmental assessments a predictive measure of performance?
* Are the performance assessments being presented to prospective managers free of individual bias?
* Are performance assessment scores standardized across organizations?

If the answer to any of these questions is “no,” presenting performance ratings could still drive inequitable, and therefore invalid, results.

当一位杰出的工程师质疑过去的表现是否真的可以预测未来的表现时，审查小组决定进行彻底的审查。最终确定，绩效评分较差的候选人如果找到新团队，则很可能克服差评。事实上，他们获得满意或模范绩效评级的可能性与从未获得过差评的候选人一样。简而言之，绩效评级仅表明一个人在被评估时在其给定角色中的表现。评级虽然是衡量特定时期绩效的重要方法，但不能预测未来的绩效，也不应用于衡量未来角色的准备情况或确定不同团队的内部候选人的资格。 （但是，它们可以用来评估员工在当前团队中的位置是否适当或不适当；因此，它们可以提供一个机会来评估如何更好地支持内部候选人前进。）

When an exceptional engineer questioned whether past performance was in fact predictive of future performance, the reviewing team decided to conduct a thorough review. In the end, it was determined that candidates who had received a poor performance rating were likely to overcome the poor rating if they found a new team. In fact, they were just as likely to receive a satisfactory or exemplary performance rating as candidates who had never received a poor rating. In short, performance ratings are indicative only of how a person is performing in their given role at the time they are being evaluated. Ratings, although an important way to measure performance during a specific period, are not predictive of future performance and should not be used to gauge readiness for a future role or qualify an internal candidate for a different team. (They can, however, be used to evaluate whether an employee is properly or improperly slotted on their current team; therefore, they can provide an opportunity to evaluate how to better support an internal candidate moving forward.)

这种分析肯定会占用大量项目时间，但积极的权衡是更公平的内部流动过程。

This analysis definitely took up significant project time, but the positive trade-off was a more equitable internal mobility process.
