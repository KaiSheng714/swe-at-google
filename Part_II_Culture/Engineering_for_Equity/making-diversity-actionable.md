# Making Diversity Actionable
<details> <summary>英文原文</summary><div style="border:1px solid #eee;padding:5px;background-color:#F2F2F2">
Systemic equity and fairness are attainable if we are willing to accept that we are all accountable for the systemic discrimination we see in the technology sector. We are accountable for the failures in the system. Deferring or abstracting away personal accountability is ineffective, and depending on your role, it could be irresponsible. It is also irresponsible to fully attribute dynamics at your specific company or within your team to the larger societal issues that contribute to inequity. A favorite line among diversity proponents and detractors alike goes something like this: “We are working hard to fix (insert systemic discrimination topic), but accountability is hard. How do we combat (insert hundreds of years) of historical discrimination?” This line of inquiry is a detour to a more philosophical or academic conversation and away from focused efforts to improve work conditions or outcomes. Part of building multi‐ cultural capacity requires a more comprehensive understanding of how systems of inequality in society impact the workplace, especially in the technology sector.

If you are an engineering manager working on hiring more people from underrepresented groups, deferring to the historical impact of discrimination in the world is a useful academic exercise. However, it is critical to move beyond the academic conversation to a focus on quantifiable and actionable steps that you can take to drive equity and fairness. For example, as a hiring software engineer manager, you’re accountable for ensuring that your candidate slates are balanced. Are there women or other underrepresented groups in the pool of candidates’ reviews? After you hire someone, what opportunities for growth have you provided, and is the distribution of opportunities equitable? Every technology lead or software engineering manager has the means to augment equity on their teams. It is important that we acknowledge that, although there are significant systemic challenges, we are all part of the system. It is our problem to fix.
