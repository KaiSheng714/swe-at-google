# 了解多样性的需求
在 Google，我们认为，作为一名出色的工程师，您还需要专注于将不同的视角引入产品设计和实施。 这也意味着负责招聘或面试其他工程师的 Google 员工必须为建立更具代表性的员工队伍做出贡献。 例如，如果您为公司的职位面试其他工程师，重要的是要了解在招聘过程中如何产生有偏见的结果。 了解如何预测和预防伤害有重要的先决条件。 为了达到我们可以为每个人建造的地步，我们首先必须了解我们的代表性人群。 我们需要鼓励工程师进行更广泛的教育培训。

At Google, we believe that being an exceptional engineer requires that you also focus on bringing diverse perspectives into product design and implementation. It also means that Googlers responsible for hiring or interviewing other engineers must con‐ tribute to building a more representative workforce. For example, if you interview other engineers for positions at your company, it is important to learn how biased outcomes happen in hiring. There are significant prerequisites for understanding how to anticipate harm and prevent it. To get to the point where we can build for everyone, we first must understand our representative populations. We need to encourage engineers to have a wider scope of educational training.

首要任务是打破这样一种观念，即作为拥有计算机科学学位和/或工作经验的人，您拥有成为杰出工程师所需的所有技能。 计算机科学学位通常是必要的基础。 但是，仅凭学位（即使加上工作经验）不会使您成为工程师。 打破只有拥有计算机科学学位的人才可以设计和制造产品的观念也很重要。 今天，大多数程序员确实拥有计算机科学学位。 他们在构建代码、建立变革理论和应用解决问题的方法方面取得了成功。 然而，正如上述示例所示，这种方法不足以实现包容和公平的工程。

The first order of business is to disrupt the notion that as a person with a computer science degree and/or work experience, you have all the skills you need to become an exceptional engineer. A computer science degree is often a necessary foundation. However, the degree alone (even when coupled with work experience) will not make you an engineer. It is also important to disrupt the idea that only people with computer science degrees can design and build products. Today, most programmers do have a computer science degree; they are successful at building code, establishing theories of change, and applying methodologies for problem solving. However, as the aforementioned examples demonstrate, this approach is insufficient for inclusive and equitable engineering.

工程师应该首先将所有工作集中在他们寻求影响的完整生态系统的框架内。 至少，他们需要了解用户的人口统计数据。 工程师应该关注与自己不同的人，尤其是那些可能试图使用他们的产品造成伤害的人。 最难考虑的用户是那些被他们访问技术的过程和环境剥夺权利的用户。 为了应对这一挑战，工程团队需要代表他们现有和未来的用户。 在工程团队缺乏多元化代表的情况下，个别工程师需要学习如何为所有用户构建。

Engineers should begin by focusing all work within the framing of the complete eco‐ system they seek to influence. At minimum, they need to understand the population demographics of their users. Engineers should focus on people who are different than themselves, especially people who might attempt to use their products to cause harm. The most difficult users to consider are those who are disenfranchised by the pro‐ cesses and the environment in which they access technology. To address this challenge, engineering teams need to be representative of their existing and future users. In the absence of diverse representation on engineering teams, individual engineers need to learn how to build for all users.
