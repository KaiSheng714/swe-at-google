# 软件工程与编程

<details> <summary>英文原文</summary><div style="border:1px solid #eee;padding:5px;background-color:#F2F2F2">
When presented with our distinction between software engineering and programming, you might ask whether there is an inherent value judgement in play. Is programming somehow worse than software engineering? Is a project that is expected to last a decade with a team of hundreds inherently more valuable than one that is useful
for only a month and built by two people?

当谈到我们在软件工程和编程之间的区别时，您可能会问是否有内在的价值判断在起作用。编程是否比软件工程更糟糕？一个由数百人组成的团队预计将持续十年的项目是否比一个仅用一个月并由两个人构建的项目更有价值？&#x20;

Of course not. Our point is not that software engineering is superior, merely that these represent two different problem domains with distinct constraints values, and best practices. Rather, the value in pointing out this difference comes from recognizing that some tools are great in one domain but not in the other. You probably don’t need to rely on integration tests (see Chapter 14) and Continuous Deployment (CD)practices (see Chapter 24) for a project that will last only a few days. Similarly, all of our long-term concerns about semantic versioning (SemVer) and dependency management in software engineering projects (see Chapter 21) don’t really apply for short-term programming projects: use whatever is available to solve the task at hand.

当然不是。我们的观点不是软件工程优越，只是它们代表了两个具有不同约束、价值和最佳实践的不同问题域。相反，指出这种差异的价值来自于认识到某些工具在一个领域很好，而在另一个领域则不然。对于仅持续几天的项目，您可能不需要依赖集成测试（参见第 14 章）和持续部署 (CD) 实践（参见第 24 章）。类似地，我们对软件工程项目（见第 21 章）中的语义版本控制 (SemVer) 和依赖管理的所有长期关注并不真正适用于短期编程项目：使用任何可用的东西来解决手头的问题。&#x20;

We believe it is important to differentiate between the related-but-distinct terms “programming” and “software engineering.” Much of that difference stems from the management of code over time, the impact of time on scale, and decision making in the face of those ideas. Programming is the immediate act of producing code. Software engineering is the set of policies, practices, and tools that are necessary to make that code useful for as long as it needs to be used and allowing collaboration across a team.

我们认为区分相关但不同的术语“编程”和“软件工程”很重要。大部分差异源于代码随时间的管理、时间对规模的影响以及面对这些想法时的决策。编程是生成代码的直接行为。软件工程是一组策略、实践和工具，它们是使代码在需要使用时有用并允许跨团队协作所必需的。
